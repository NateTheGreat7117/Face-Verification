This model was created using pairwise training. This compares two samples from a dataset and outputs the probability that they come from the same class. Theoretically, the model should be able to distinguish between any two faces, although there is still a lot of error in the model. It could be improved by increasing the size of the dataset, using different algorithms, or increasing augmentation and image preprocessing.
